# Code-Refactor-Module 1 Challenge

## Description

As A developer, I WANT to change the starter code by using semantic HTML elements SO THAT the code base can be easier to follow and to read. Additionally, I will consolidate the CSS selectors and properties to make the website more accessible.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

Following the link provided in the assignment suggestion, the website should be open in Chrome. To view the source code, or to retrieve the semantics HTML elements, and the CSS selectors it is suggested to use the Chrome DevTools.

## Notes

The following steps demonstrate the process:

* The starter code was orignally cloned from the starter code repository
* A new repository was created
* The HTML file was changed by using semantics elements to make it easier for any reader to follow
* Subsequently, the CSS file was updated to follow the semantic structure of the HTML file so that the format of the website can remain the same
* Comments were added to CSS file as a guide
* The repository was updated to reflect the changes
